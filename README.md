# Thermodynamics-of-Materials
Final Assignment for ESM 511 at Stony Brook University

The assignment included in this repository was the final project for ESM 511: Thermodynamics of Materials, a graduate-level statistical mechanics course at Stony Brook University. The code is written in C and implements two versions of a lattice Monte Carlo model for predicting phase transitions. The assignment page is included. To summarize, a 128 x 128 lattice was initialized with a proportion of 0.6 particles with positive magnetization and 0.4 with negative. Each Monte Carlo step consisted of N x N attempted flips using a standard Hamiltonian. Energy was plotted as a function of J and equilibrium was quantified by monitoring the average behavior of energy over time. The final configuration of the system was plotted as a function of J/kT between 0.1 - 0.8 and this was used to identify the specific heat. The above process was then repeated for a kinetic Monte Carlo model utilizing the spin hopping process and 10% vacancies in the system.
